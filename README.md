In the rapidly evolving music industry, understanding what drives the popularity of songs is crucial for strategic decision-making. This project, developed for SonicWave Productions, leverages machine learning to predict the popularity of songs across three different genres: rock, jazz, and pop. By analyzing various musical attributes such as duration, loudness, and time signature, this model empowers music professionals to identify undervalued or overvalued songs, aiding in song selection, promotion, and distribution.
